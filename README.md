## My Engineering Thesis' Title: "Designing and building a mobile robot with a control system based on the Arduino development board"

### • Educational institution: "Vasile Alecsandri" University of Bacău, Romania (Faculty of Engineering)

### • Academic degree obtained: Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering and Information Technology (2019)

### • Goal/Practicality: To create a miniature autonomous firefighting robot from scratch, modeled as a firetruck

### • The thesis involved working with Arduino IDE (code written in C programming language), IR (infrared) sensors and servo motors
